We are a contemporary dermatology practice conveniently located in Downtown Bellevue and West Yakima. Dr. Samir Master and Dr. Casey Carlos, our dermatologists, focus on medical and surgical dermatology. We utilize a variety of modalities to help patients with their conditions, are conscious of the costs of healthcare, and offer both surgical and non-surgical approaches to many conditions. We are in network with major national insurance plans including: Premera, Regence, Cigna, Aetna, and importantly Medicare, and also facilitate billing with out of network insurance plans.

If you are looking for a "user-friendly" Dermatologist, think about our practice!! Dr. Carlos, Dr. Master, and our team are known for their gracious attention to detail. Patient reviews (for example at www.zocdoc.com) for our dermatologists comment on their communication skills, attentiveness, bedside manner and most importantly--excellent outcomes!! We're consistently the top-rated dermatologist's practice on the East Side and are humbled by this distinction. The Bellevue office is in a chic Old Bellevue home that has been carefully converted to a modern dermatology practice. We are steps away from Bellevue Square Mall and the QFC. Our private parking lot behind the building has ample free surface level parking. In Yakima, we are at the Creekside Office Park off of 40th near West Washington. Again, we have ample, handicapped-accessible parking in front of our door.
